00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.840
So, my love
Forgive me if I wasn’t what you wanted

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:35.440
My mistake was not to value you and let you go
And now I feel as if it’s an eclipse

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.880
So, my love
Forgive me if I wasn’t what you wanted

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:53.880
My mistake was not to value you and let you go
And now I feel as if it’s an eclipse

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:03.480
For someone who got in between you and me

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.229
For someone who got in between…

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.900
It’s twelve at night and I don’t know
How long it will take to see you again

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.010
I know what you want, babe
I don’t want to piss you off

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.660
You have me spinning like a satellite
You don’t even realize if I speak to you

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.149
She is bad as Hell
And if she’s upset

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.300
Instead of calling me Love she calls me Mauro
If you want the forbidden fruit

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.239
Tell me when you want
We repeat Adam y  Eva’s like Paulo

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:33.770
It’s better to be alone than in bad company
And sleep alone on the other bed

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.619
Weeks without having you by my side

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.590
Put me out of orbit but
It’s better to be alone than in bad company

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.160
And sleep alone on the other bed
Weeks without having you by my side

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.670
Put me out of orbit

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.400
So, my love
Forgive me if I wasn’t what you wanted

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:06.920
My mistake was not to value you and let you go
And now I feel as if it’s an eclipse

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.680
For someone who got in between you and me

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.200
Half of my world darkened because you’re not there

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.280
But I still have the other half 
that I didn’t give to you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.040
My mind blew off
You were near but I didn´t see you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.160
So many steps that I understood that…

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.040
It’s better to be alone than in bad company
And sleep alone on the other bed

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.600
Weeks without having you by my side
Put me out of orbit but...

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.080
It’s better to be alone than in bad company

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.920
Weeks without having you by my side
Put me out of orbit 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.640
So, my love
Forgive me if I wasn’t what you wanted

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:19.320
My mistake was not to value you and let you go
And now I feel as if it’s an eclipse

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.560
For someone who got in between you and me
